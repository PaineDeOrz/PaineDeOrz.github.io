Introduction
===========

- Current status of the game (popularity, trends, problems and hopes)
- Motivation of chess as AI/ML application
- Motivation for human-alignment in the world of chess computers
- Personal motivation for the choice of subject

History
==========

- Early hardware-based issues & developments, brute force computing
- Modern algorithmic approaches
- Stockfish (heuristic-based) vs AlphaZero/Leela (NN-based)
- (?)Detailed comparison in the workings of engines (with study)
- Examples of limitations and powers of modern-day engines, again motivation to human-alignment

MAIA
==========

- Data, move prediction task
- Implementation of the NN
- Motivation of no MCTS
- Results (Turing test?)
- Blunder prediction and possible uses

ALLIE
==========

- Data again (now with metadata)
- Deep-dive in decoder-only transformer model
- Design of LLM for chess & why natural language - weights work
- Motivation for MCTS
- Results (both offline evaluation & human qualitative feedback)
- Personal opinion (?)

Looking at the future
==========

- Issues in present and upcoming models, tough problems regarding data
- What computers can do, should become able to do, and what they can't used for
- How research in chess can translate into other applications
